### Motivation

Data analysis is an important area for sport scientists. Regardless the level of experience, being able to showcase skills in this area will help in future job interviews, networking or help create opportunities to collaborate with others in the field. Not all sport scientists may have access to the type of data that is usually available to professional teams and sport organizations however, nowadays there are many publicly available datasets that can be used to show your skills, philosophy and creativity when it comes to sport science analysis. Below you will be able to find a few and we hope to continue adding to the list over time.

### How to contribute
Contributions to help grow this resource are more than welcome so others can benefit. The only requirements are:

* Update the `README` file with a bullet point refering to your dataset, following the same format including: title, brief explanation, download link, source link, file type.  

* If you have access to the raw dataset upload it to the repo. If the dataset has more than one file please create a folder that contains all the files. Consider adding a document briefly explaining the metrics along with the files if needed.  

* Use the source link on the `README` paragraph to credit the person who made the data available, or the original location where the dataset can be found. If this is your own dataset then credit yourself! The source link is important, so users know where to go to learn more about that dataset.  

* Topics of interest include optical/sensor athlete tracking, athlete monitoring data, physical profiling, injuries, schedule metrics, biomechanics, video materials, etc from any sport. Companies that provide data through technology are also welcome to upload sample datasets so more sport scientist can become familiar with that information.
